# Recursion_with_Muneer

Recursion means "defining a problem in terms of itself". This can be a very powerful tool in writing algorithms. 

Recursion comes directly from Mathematics, where there are many examples of expressions written in terms of themselves. 

For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as: F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2)
